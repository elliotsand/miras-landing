          <p><strong>Family home is perfect example of high-end innovative construction.</strong></p>
          <p>Located in the suburb of Bieldside, 15 minutes from Aberdeen city centre, Gordon Mitchell Contractors were
            appointed to build a traditional six-bedroom family home.</p>
          <p>The stunning 770m<sup>2</sup> property, accompanied by pristine gardens and an external lounge/kitchen area
            maintains traditional features, whilst boasting a contemporary twist with spotless modern interiors.</p>
          <p>We encountered some challenging elements throughout the project in both preparation and construction
            phases. A full demolition was to take place of a large existing house on the site prior to the scheduled new
            build. The difficulty of this process was exacerbated by the confined working space we were granted due to
            the boundaries set by tree protection specialists from Aberdeen City Council.</p>
          <p>The construction of the new building also shared these same challenges, but due to expert planning,
            co-ordination and communication, the site area was managed effectively.</p>

          <p>For the duration of the project we worked closely with Alan Forbes Architects and Mcleod &amp; Aitken to
            ensure the build met the brief, and exceeded the customers’ expectations in construction and style.</p>
          <p>Alongside ticking multiple boxes in terms of innovation by utilising new building technologies, this house
            is a perfect example of the high-end construction the GMC team is capable of delivering.</p>
          <p>We were recommended and shortlisted to the client as one of the North-east of Scotland’s top building
            contractors. After a thorough interview process, we were awarded the contract.</p>
          <p>Since then, we have built a great working relationship with the owner and were recently invited back to
            complete an extension on to the rear of the building.</p>
